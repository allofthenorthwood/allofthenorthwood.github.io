There's something about this game. Something beyond the witty dialogue, the loveable characters, the soundtrack that you happily listen to on repeat for days. There's something really special in here.

Undertale looks like a traditional Zelda-style game – your character walks around, carries items, strikes up conversations, and battles monsters. It all seems so traditional. And then it *hits you in the feels*.

Right there next to the "bash this monster's head in with a stick" button, is a "try to make the monster feel better" button. It's your choice. You can whack or you can talk. Or joke. Or hug. Or unhug. And just like that, with a tiny little change, Undertale has given you the *choice* to be violent.

Give the player the choice to be non-violent and you shift the entire playing field. Now they can't claim they were following directions. Now when the player kills – an action completely ingrained into normal video games - it was their own choice, knowing full well that there was another route they could have just as easily taken.

This changed how I think about video games. Even games that minimize gore, where you simply wave your sword and the monster vanishes in a fountain of XP and loot, are tainted by this feeling that I'm dong something wrong. That I could be making a better choice.
