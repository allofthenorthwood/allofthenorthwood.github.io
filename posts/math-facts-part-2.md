So I have this [idea for a project](/post/math-facts-part-1). It isn't a well defined project, and I have no idea if it will be useful at all, or what will come of it. At Khan Academy, we propose new projects by writing up a project proposal, getting feedback, and sending it into the Project Pipeline to be approved or deferred as the mighty gods of the pipeline see fit. I need to convince them that having me work on building this Math Facts app will be worth it – that this is something worth building, that it aligns with the KA mission, and that this project has a high probabilty of success.

![This is a thing that I drew. It's three people in greek-god style togas with their arms crossed and they have no eyes because it looked more dramatic that way. They look like people made from the sun, and they are looking down on you (except I guess they have no eyes???) and will pass judgement on your project proposal. They are actually three people I work with. They're all nice. I hope they think this is funny. I wonder if anyone reads the silly things I write in the alt-text.](../images/project-pipeline-gods.jpg "The project pipeline gods. (Dramatization)")

The vague idea in my head is something along the lines of:

- It's important for people to know their multiplication tables.
- Khan Academy doesn't adequately help people memorize their multiplication tables with what we currently have on the site.
- I can make a phone app will help people learn their multiplication tables.
- Therefore we should have me make this app!

![This shows a screenshot of our project template doc. The highlights are that it needs a problem statement, an objective, a timeframe (all projects are 2-5 weeks, and a list of people (or types of people, like an engineer and a designer) who will work on it. It also has room for adding more background information. There's a link in the caption!)](../images/project-proposal-doc.jpg "Khan Academy's project proposal [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12PuKDPfwD3SJg90nbOjnYcfFRXP0CMB117Cng7Zfo6g/edit?usp=sharing).")

At this point I should probably come clean. I've never made an iPhone app!

Luckily, a shiny new project has just become available to solve this problem: [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) allows JavaScript developers like me to throw together a *native* iOS app using, you guessed it, [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and plain old JavaScript.

So what did I do? I did the logical next step and threw my ideas down on doc-paper, sent it to a few of my co-workers to get some feedback, and got some great feedback:

> I would consider making this very focused on **specifically what can be delivered** and in what timeframe. Leave no ambiguity about what you're proposing to build. I think the explanation of lean startup and user testing muddies the water a bit and casts doubt that you're sure you know what you'd build. 4-5 weeks for an MVP is a short enough cycle to just go heads-down and build something, provided you have a clear vision.

> You want to leave readers with **unambiguous clarity** that "I completely understand everything this thing will do and it will definitely exist after x weeks of work". I'll add comments to the doc pointing out areas where I'm unsure about what's planned. High level though, you want to be sure to paint the picture in the mind of the reader of exactly what will be built. Your screenshots are already a HUGE help here, but I think you could tighten up some of the wording too.

> The other thing you want to leave readers with is **complete confidence in the schedule**. Having clarity about what's being built is obviously a prereq for having confidence in the schedule, but breaking the schedule down helps provide additional confidence that the project will be a success. For reference, any time I see an estimate that's not broken down into <1 week increments, I assume it's probably BS and the project hasn't been thought through in detail yet, increasing the risk of schedule-ruining roadblocks popping up.

> I think if you can nail the above, you could make this look like a pretty low-risk investment. It's still not obviously aligned with our current strategy, so I'm not sure exactly how it will be received, but if folks have the confidence that "I understand this project and it doesn't sound risky", it'll be more likely they'll take the additional risk of doing a thing that hasn't been pressure-tested as well as our existing strategy. Personally, I think building an MVP and tossing it into the app store is a pretty reasonable R&D project—hopefully others agree.
