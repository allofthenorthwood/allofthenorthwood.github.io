Open offices are great for feeling like you're part of a community, but can make it hard to get things done. Here I use a series of silly drawings to show my attempt at a solution.

Everyone knows that standing desks make you more productive! Take advantage of this by being in close proximity to a standing desk at all times.

![Another not-great drawing of me showing off my desk fort. It's just a standing desk with 30 pieces of paper taped together to make walls around the sides of the desk.](../images/open-office-step-2.jpg "Step 2: Tape 30 pieces of paper together to make walls for your new desk fort" 500)

Building a fort becomes a lot easier when your desk is already enclosed on a few sides. If your desk isn't, try swapping desks with someone who likes having a cool breeze on their legs.

![A drawing of a water bottle, two packages of food (they're literally labelled "food" and "more food" because this drawing isn't very good), and a pillow.](../images/open-office-step-3.jpg "Step 3: Equip the fort with water, snacks, and pillows" 500)

You're probably not going to want to leave the safety of your fort very often, so make sure to stock up on essentions. Pro tip: this has the added benefit that if you trap yourself under your desk with only healthy snacks, you'll probably eat those instead of going to get alternatives.

The image on the iPhone screen is supposed to be the Undertale soundtrack but the marker I was using was too thick so it's just a heart and the letters "UT".](../images/open-office-step-4.jpg "Step 4: Video game soundtrack" 500)

Video game soundtracks help you concentrate and also make you feel more awesome.

![A handwritten image of the word "code" written 50 times. Okay I'm lying, I only wrote it 15 times. I'm sorry for lying. You're great.](../images/open-office-step-5.jpg "Step 5: Sit under the desk." 500)

Feel free to replace "code" with other tasks that you might need to get done, like "email", "write", "nap", "work", or "blog".
