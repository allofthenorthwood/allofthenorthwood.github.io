About a year ago, I casually mentioned to a [coworker](https://twitter.com/ariabuckles) that it's great that all the people named "Ben" at Khan Academy (we have like, seven) have different colored last names because that makes it easier to tell their names apart.

This led to a long conversation where we compared our colors for every letter and number (it turns out some of ours are the same but most are different) and talked about how we remembered various things based on their colors, like phone numbers or names or digits of pi.

Then I asked some of my other friends what colors they had for each letter, and their reply was something along the lines of "wh— what...? What are you talking about?" because of course, words don't have colors.

When someone's perception of letters and numbers is associated with an experience of color, it's called [grapheme to color synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme_%E2%86%92_color_synesthesia). I managed to land on that very helpful Wikipedia page soon after realizing that this was a thing that had a name and would highly recommend it for an overview.

Before that conversation a year ago, I didn't ever think about colors and numbers or colors and letters, so I'm not even sure how long I've had these associations. I can tell you that the associations I have now are very consistent and incredibly helpful for remembering long strings of numbers. I can easily rhyme off that 2^50 is 1125899906842624, because the color pattern is so distinct in my mind. However, each time I rhyme it off I almost always stumble when I get to 42624, because the digits 2, 4, and 6 are very similar colors.

Below is a widget where you can see my colors and play around with making your own set. You can type anything you'd like on the left, so you can see how the number 16,777,216 is pink and yellow, while the number 33,554,432 is overwhelmed by green and red. You'll also be able to see why the pattern 42624 causes me so much trouble.

[[@ synesthesia]]

People have tried compiling data for which colors people associate with each letter and number, and it [yields some interesting patterns](http://www.musanim.com/synesthesia/).

This trait isn't always helpful, and it often causes me to remember the color pattern for a particular word instead of the actual spelling or sound. For example, I have a terrible time keeping names that begin with the letters "Ka" straight – like Karina, Karen, Katrina, Katerina, Katherine, etc. – because I rely so heaily on the colors instead of the sound.

Anyway. Brains are weird.
