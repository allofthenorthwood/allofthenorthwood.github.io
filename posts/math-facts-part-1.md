* make this post less judgy? I don't want to make it sound like lack of numeracy or literacy means you're not good enough! :(

Education is really important. Education is the reason you are where you are today. Education is probably also the reason why you're not where you want to be. Education is about hard work, about grit, about perserverence. But education is also about privilege. The privilege of being born into a family that supports your education. The privilege of going to a good school. The privilege of being surrounded by positive attitudes towards learning. A huge part of why I'm dedicating my life to education is that I want to do what I can to level the playing field.

By day, I'm already on the education train. I managed to land a job at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org), an organization with the goal to create a free world-class education for anyone anywhere. Leveraging this team of 80 people, our connections, and our combined talents greatly increases the impact I can have. This is amazing opportunity to do good. But I want to do even more good.

One of the pain points I've been obsessing over for a few years is **basic number sense**. Being comfortable with number manipulations means that you can focus on the higher order concepts without constantly stumbling over manipulating digits.

## What is number sense?

Number sense is being comfortable with numbers. You see a number and have an immediate reaction to how big that number is. You can estimate the result of operations on any number, such as adding to it, multiplying it, squaring it, etc. You can round the number based on any criteria. You can order numbers by size.

Obviously the scale of this comfort varies greatly for different number sets. Being comfortable will whole numbers less than 10, or less than 100, or common fractions, is a different story than being able to say you are comfortable with numbers in the range of `2.2034832E64` or `33/567`. But this ability scales very nicely!

## Number sense is fundamental to math

I argue that number sense is as fundamental to math as the ability to sight-read is to literacy. Imagine reading a novel and having to sound out each word. You'd be able to brute force through short sentences and words, like "The dog is red!" but how would you even begin to wrap your mind around the prose of a biology textbook? Shakespeare's plays? The Great Gatsby? At some point you'd pass from being able to make it through a sentence, to a complete wall. The sentence just would be lost in a sea of letters, and the higher level concepts wouldn't even make an appearance. Suddenly it would be just too hard, and that would be it. You'd say, "this is all above my head!" and you'd walk away.

This is what happens with math.

I bet that reading through this post, not once did you stop to sound out a word or remark at how it was spelt – you simply digested the content as you read it, as it passed through an invisible filter that you built when you were a child sounding out big words and stumbling through sentences.

If you take in numbers on a page as a series of glyphs that have no weight, no feeling, and no connections to each other or to other parts of your life, then an equation is a cryptic mess. Lack of number sense makes you trip over every *carry the two* or *bring the 4 to the left side of the equation*. You can't see the forest through the trees.

## What can we do about it?

I want to find a way to teach number sense and numeracy in a way that makes reading equations as effortless as sight-reading the words on this page. I want to also make it available to as many people as possible, so I need a distribution method that is scalable and doesn't require paying for a private tutor.

This isn't going to be easy.

I'm thinking I'll start with something fundamental that Khan Academy doesn't cover yet: multiplication tables. Sure we have all the exercises, but they're not set up in a way that checks if you have all the answers memorized, and there isn't a way to check progress for each product individually (e.g. 7×8 is very different from 2×2).

I could do addition of 1-digit numbers too, since they mirror multiplication facts so nicely. After that we can tackle their inverses, subtraction and division, as well as becoming comfortable with mixed operations. Any teacher will tell you that division gets much easier when you know your multiplication tables.

That means the baseline will be getting to the point where your basic **Math Facts** – addition and multiplication – are automatic.
