A few weeks ago, I went to see an advance screening of The Martian. I had this strange and surreal opportunity because Ann Doerr, Chairman of Khan Academy's board, is the kind of wonderful human being who reserves an entire movie theatre to show a bunch of her friends and a few starstruck employees of Khan Academy (like me!) a really epic space movie before everyone else in the world gets to see it.

Fuck." and he looks a little put-off by the fact that he's standing deserted on Mars.](../images/the-martian.png "A summary of the entire book and movie of The Martian. No, I'm kidding, there was more to it than this. It was spectacular. Much science. Many feelings." 600)

We also all got free copies of the book!

And Andy Weir was there. Andy Weir, as in the author of The Martian: A Novel. A person who has met Matt Damon. Matt Damon was excited to be in the movie based on his book. I've basically met Matt Damon now.

And to top it all off, we were allowed to take anything from the concession area for free.

*For free.*

Beyond the part where I highly recommend the movie and the book and highly don't recommend eating as many sour gummy worms as will physically fit into your stomach, I walked away with some really solid writing advice.

After the movie, Andy took some questions, and one answer stuck with me. It's an answer that I have now completely re-written into my own words because this event was two months ago.

**Q. Do you have any advice to aspiring writers?**

**A.** Yes! This is my advice:

1. **Actually write.** Spend time writing your book, not just thinking about it. If you write a page a day then after a year you will have a book and if you don't then you will not have a book. Write. Physically do it. Write words. Write them often. Write your story down.

2. **Don't *tell* anyone your story â€“ make them read it.** If you go around telling everyone the plot to your book, it will satisfy that deep, rumbling pain in your gut that is your story trying to get out. Do not satisfy the monster through talking. Use your desire to *tell* people about the story to fuel yourself into *writing* the story. Then you will have a book. After you write it. So write it. See point #1.

3. **Self publish!** We live in a world where anyone can write anything and put it on the internet, where millions of other people will be able to read it. Publishing companies will give you distribution channels and marketing and connections, but they're no longer a necessity to get started. Make a website. Put your words there. Get feedback. Write more. And remember to actually write.
